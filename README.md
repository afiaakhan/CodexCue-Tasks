# CodexCue-Tasks
Welcome to the repository for my Python development internship at CodexCue. Over the course of this internship, I have completed three exciting tasks: 
1) Calculator
2) Music App
3) URL Shortener

Each project helped me enhance my skills in Python programming and gave me valuable hands-on experience.
